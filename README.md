# Retro-games Launcher v0.3

This is a retro games Launcher created by me :)


To run the launcher, launch the file main.py

Then click on pong or snake to chose the game you want to play

Before to play, you have to tap the space bar 

(The first frame of the game is black so the black screen is normal)


To mute the background music you can tap M

To make the game pause you can tap the space bar


Warning : Sometimes the game's window can be generated behing the launcher's window

(in this case, you have to select the game's window to see it)
